# Jonathan Potter

I am a self taught web developer with two years of experience developing applications with javascript and React.  I have approximately a year of experience developing Express apps and using TypeScript for both Express and React applications.  I have some familiarity with Python, and can easily learn more in that language.

I have many example projects of what I have learned so far, and I am looking for my first web developement job. You can view my portfolio [here](https://portfolio-next-snowy-omega.vercel.app/).
